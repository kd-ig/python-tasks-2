## so my first code first takes an input from the user. Next it checks the remainder of the number when devided by 2 , if it satisfies the condition which is if it is 0 then it declares it as a even numbers else it is an odd number 

## In the 2nd code firstly a list is stated ranging fromm 1 to 50. The code then uses sthe for loop to consider each number as a seperate entity and then adds each one of them till the end of the list and lastly prints their sum as as the final output
